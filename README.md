☀️ Berlin vs. Brooklyn Weather

## Which city gets more sun — my old home Berlin or my new home Brooklyn?

This repository contains the notebooks, code, and files for my personal weather project comparing sunshine and temperatures in Berlin and Brooklyn. I wanted to find out: which city is actually sunnier?

I used Python and Pandas for the analysis, and visualized the results mostly in Datawrapper. Some charts were exported as SVGs and edited further in Figma.

### My motivation with this project: 
- Practice working with time series in Pandas
- build more advanced Datawrapper visualizations
- automate updates using GitHub Actions and the Datawrapper API
- use a simple weather API and create live graphics from it

### Data sources 
Weather data from [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs?forecast_days=3&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min&timezone=America%2FNew_York)
